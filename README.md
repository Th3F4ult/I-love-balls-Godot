# I-love-balls-Godot

Godot balls... stuff... like, idk, physics and shit.

Right Mouse > Spawns balls

Left Mouse > Open menu (Should be obvious)

Middle Mouse (Hold) > Delete mode

PD: The raycast from the mouse goes to the RIGHT, keep that in mind.

PPD: Check the "DEMOS" folder for some instances to add. Use the Godot editor to create your own.
